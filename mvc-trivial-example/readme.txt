MVC stands for Model-View-Controller

* View
- Is what the web-application shows to the user
- Use only html codes, and minimal php printing/echoing

* Controller
- This controls the whole app
- Has three basic parts:
- 1. input validation
- 2. calls to a model method
- 3. loads the appropriate view

* Model
- Classes, that contains the logical structure of the app
